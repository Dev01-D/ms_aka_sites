## ⌨️ Advanced Keyboard Navigation
*Teach these to technicians for navigating a user's PC when their mouse is broken or lagging.*

* **Win + V**: Opens **Clipboard History**. (Must be enabled first, but a lifesaver for repetitive data entry).
* **Win + Period (.)**: Opens the **Emoji/Symbol picker**. Great for finding arrows or special characters for documentation.
* **Alt + Space, then X**: Maximizes the current window.
* **Alt + Space, then M**: Move a window using arrow keys (essential when a window is "stuck" off-screen on a disconnected second monitor).
* **Ctrl + Win + Left/Right Arrow**: Switch between **Virtual Desktops**. Useful for keeping "Personal" and "IT Work" separate during a screen share.

* ## 💡 Service Desk "Pro Tips"
* **The "Copy Error" Trick**: Press **Ctrl + C** on any standard Windows error dialog to copy the text.
* **Elevated Run**: Press **Ctrl + Shift + Enter** in the Run box to launch any tool as Admin.
* **God Mode**: Create a folder named `GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}` for a master settings list.

> [!TIP]
> To run any command as **Admin** from the Run box (Win+R), press `Ctrl + Shift + Enter`.
